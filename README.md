Barcode Scanner for FileMaker

It uses the JavaScript edition of [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/) to scan barcodes from browsers on PC or mobiles devices and then pass the results to the receiver in the web viewer of FileMaker to insert records.

In this demo, it gets the ISBN barcode result, retrieves the book's info through [OpenLibrary's API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books) and inserts the data.
